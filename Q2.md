# Difference Between Arrays and Linked Lists

## Memory Allocation

### Arrays
Arrays use a contiguous block of memory allocated at once. This means all elements are stored sequentially in memory.

**Example:**

```java
int[] arr = new int[5]; // Reserves 5 consecutive memory slots
```

### Linked Lists
Linked lists use non-contiguous memory allocation. This allows the list to grow dynamically without requiring continuous memory space.

**Example:**

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int data) { this.data = data; this.next = null; }
}
```

A node might be at memory address 10, pointing to 15, then 20.

## Performance

### Arrays
Arrays provide O(1) access time because elements can be accessed directly using an index, but insertion and deletion are slower.

**Example:**

```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(arr[2]); 
```

### Linked Lists
Linked lists have O(n) access time because traversal is required to reach an element, but insertion and deletion are faster.

**Example:**

```java
Node temp = head;
for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    temp = temp.next; // Must follow links: head → node1 → node2
}
System.out.println(temp.data);
```

## Insertion and Deletion

### Arrays
Inserting or deleting elements in arrays is slow because shifting is required. Insertion and deletion at the beginning take O(n) time, while they take O(1) at the end if space is available.

**Example:**

```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};
int newElement = 5;
for (int i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    arr[i] = arr[i - 1]; // Shift elements right
}
arr[0] = newElement;
```

### Linked Lists
Linked lists allow O(1) insertion or deletion at the beginning because only pointers need to be updated.

**Example:**

```java
Node newNode = new Node(15);
newNode.next = head.next; // Insert after head
head.next = newNode;
```
